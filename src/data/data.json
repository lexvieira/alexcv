      "I am Alex, a hyperactive, troubleshooter, and resilient systems analyst, passionate about technology since 1995. I have worked from technical Support to complex IT projects, and for more than ten years for Telecom and Broker companies automating processes. I am the bridge gap between clients and IT. I have been participating in all project life cycle phases as a full-stack developer and data analyst, most of the time in legacy systems.",
      "I am returning to the IT area after a sabbatical break traveling in Europe and Asia since 2018, discovering new cultures, studying languages, and learning about recycling processes using technology. Ready for a career restart, entering UX, DevOps, Docker, React/React Native, and Data Analytics, expecting to have the opportunity to participate in projects that can help the world to become a better place. Sustainability, Education, or Health areas, making technology arrives in places where it barely exists."
